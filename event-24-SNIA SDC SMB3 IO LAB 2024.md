Please join us at the SNIA SDC SMB3 IO Lab event, co-sponsored with SNIA, from September 16-19, 2024. The purpose of this Interoperability Lab is for vendors to test their implementations of SMB3 and identify and fix bugs in a collaborative setting with the goal of providing a forum in which companies can develop interoperable products.

**When:** September 16-19, 2024 
**Where:** Santa Clara, California  
**Who:** Storage Developers

SNIA supports the network and infrastructure for the IO Lab, creating a collaborative framework for testing. The participants of the IO Lab work together to define the testing process, assuring that objectives are accomplished.

New this year: The IO Lab will end on Thursday 9/19, so you can continue testing after the main conference ends!

### The SNIA SMB3 IO Lab offers:

- The latest Windows client and server software from Microsoft, including test suites that help verify interoperability on various features of SMB3 protocols.
- Technical support from SMB3 engineers to look at traces and help with diagnosing problems.
- Opportunities to learn from the experts.

### SNIA SMB3 IO Lab Logistics

A primary representative from each company that wishes to participate must complete the SNIA SMB3 Plugfest Company Registration. The SMB3 IO Lab fee includes full access to the Storage Developer Conference sessions and meals. This special discounted rate is limited to participants that will actively participate and test, working with the other SMB3 IO Lab participants. Please see more details at the registration process.

> **Note:** All the IO Lab participants are covered by a non-disclosure agreement and entry is restricted to registrants only.

SNIA will provide and support the networks and infrastructure for the SNIA SMB3 IO Lab. Please note any special testing and power requirements you might need in your registration form as some may have additional costs.

The SMB3 IO Lab is also a development opportunity, not just a testing opportunity! So please join us even if you feel your SMB3 implementation is "not ready" yet.

**We look forward to seeing you at our event!**
